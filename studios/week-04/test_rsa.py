"""Provided tests for the week-4 studio. Run: ``python3 test_rsa.py``.

Passes  => your attacks are real and your fix works; you're ready for the
scorecard (Task 4) and for Duel 1 next week. Prints one line per test.

The two *guarantee* tests are the point of the week:

  * ``test_shared_factor_recovers_both_keys`` — RSA's guarantee ("infeasible to
    factor n") holds for each key ALONE but collapses across a population: two
    keys sharing a prime both fall to a single GCD. Watching an
    "each-key-is-fine" guarantee fail at population scale is the lesson.
  * ``test_constant_time_defeats_timing_attack`` — the same attack that recovers
    a secret through an early-exit compare recovers NOTHING through a
    constant-time compare. The algorithm didn't change; the *condition* did.
