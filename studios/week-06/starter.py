"""Week 6 studio — starter (web injection + the LLM-vs-scanner duel).

Fill in the functions below, then run ``python3 test_studio.py``. All provided
tests must pass, INCLUDING the guarantee test that watches the classical scanner
MISS the SQLi and neither arm cleanly find Broken Access Control — because the
vulnerability class automated tools are worst at is exactly OWASP-2021 #1, and a
lesson you can watch fail as a test is one you actually understood.

The one idea (from Session 6A): every injection is the same bug — untrusted data
crosses into a control channel (SQL / HTML / a shell). And the discipline (axis 3):
a finding is NOT real until a SOUND ORACLE confirms a security-relevant effect. A
reflected string is not XSS; a canary leak IS SQLi.

Everything runs laptop-only against 127.0.0.1 (webharness brings the app up
in-process — no Docker). Nothing here touches a network you were not authorized
to test; see ../../resources/ethics-and-scope.md.

    The oracle is the crux of the week: a reflected string is only XSS if it would

    the ``<script>`` survives UNescaped in the response (an un-encoded ``<script>``,
    NOT ``&lt;script&gt;``). Merely coming back in the body is reflection, not XSS.

    Fire the SAME payload at both endpoints and return ``(vuln_finding,
    safe_finding)``. The vulnerable ``/`` must confirm; the fixed ``/safe``
    (html.escape) must NOT — that is the true negative you carry into the duel.

    Write your own oracle ``xss_oracle(payload, response) -> (bool, str)``; do not
